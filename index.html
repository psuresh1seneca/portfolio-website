        <h3 class="hello">Hello!</h3>
        <p class="about-me"> I am a dynamic and versatile professional with expertise in cloud computing, project management, graphic design, and production operations.
            With hands-on experience in AWS, Microsoft Azure, Kubernetes, and Terraform, I have successfully deployed scalable cloud solutions and optimized 
            infrastructure automation. As a Project Coordinator at Seneca College, I managed cross-functional teams, implemented Agile methodologies, 
            and improved team productivity. My ability to lead and drive efficiency has helped ensure project success and seamless collaboration. 
            Beyond my technical background, I also work as a Freelance Graphic Designer, creating user-friendly digital interfaces, branding materials, 
            and marketing assets. My experience extends to production operations, where I have contributed to enhancing efficiency in manufacturing environments.
            I hold graduate certifications in Project Management – IT and Cloud Architecture & Administration from Seneca College, along with a 
            Bachelor’s in Computer Applications.cI thrive in fast-paced environments that require problem-solving, stakeholder management, 
            technical troubleshooting, and process optimization. Passionate about technology and design, I am always eager to take on new challenges 
            and drive impactful solutions.</p>
